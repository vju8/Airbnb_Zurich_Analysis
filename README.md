**Project name:**  
Airbnb Data Analysis in Zurich (Switzerland)

**Project Description:**  
I am a passionate traveller and I love Airbnb. It makes me enjoy the travelling experience even more and become part of the city I visit. This business 
also targeted my interest from data analysis perspective and I decided to analyze the market in Zurich, the city I live in.
This python data analysis project will give you access to hidden insights of ZÃ¼rich's Airbnb market. By leveraging statistical techniques and visualizations, 
we will dive into the dataset of listings, revealing valuable patterns, popular neighborhoods, and key factors that impact rental prices in this Swiss metropolis.
